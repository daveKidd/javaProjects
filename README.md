# Java Projects
This is a repository that contains all of the projects in Java I created and taught.  Here is a quick description of each one:

**SolarFarmProjectReactJavaBackEnd** – This is a project that tracks solar panels.  It has a react frontend with a Java/Spring backend

**SolarFarmSecurityReactJavaBackend** – This is a project that tracks solar panels.  It’s similar to the one above but adds security features found in Spring.

**VideoGameProjectCSV** – This is a project that tracks Video Games (a passion I have) using a .csv file as the data source.

**VideoGameProjectSQL** – This is a project that does the same as the project above but uses a SQL database as the data source.

**VideoGameProjectSpringDI** – This is a project that does the same as the project above but uses Spring to define and inject dependencies.

**VideoGamesProjectFrontBackEnd** - This is a project that does the same as the project above but uses a HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend.
