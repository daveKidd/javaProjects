1. Add to the POM:

<dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
            <version>5.2.7.RELEASE</version>
        </dependency>

2.  In resources folder create "dependency-config.xml"

3.  Add this in app:
        ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("dependency-config.xml");

4.  Now look at app and see what classes are being called and what classes are being passed to other classes.

    View
    repository defines where solarpanels.txt is found
    service receives repository
    controller receives service and view

    Set those up in beans in the dependendy-config.xml file

5.  Now call controller and run it in App:

        Controller controller = context.getBean(Controller.class);
        controller.run();
