1.  Bring in Spring Context

<dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
            <version>5.2.7.RELEASE</version>
        </dependency>

2.  Put a new data.properties file in resources with this:

solarPanelFilePath=./data/solarpanels.txt

we will use this later

3.  Put this right above public class App {

    @ComponentScan
    @PropertySource("classpath:data.properties")

4.  Now we need to check out App and see what classes are brought in and what classes are passed to other classes
Every class that is used/passed needs to have an annotation on it.

5.  For the first one, go to PanelFileRepository and put in @Repository and a reference to solarPanelFilePath:

@Repository
public class PanelFileRepository {

AND

public PanelFileRepository(@Value("${foragerFilePath}") String filePath){ this.filePath = filePath; }

6. Go to PanelService and add @Service

7. Go to View and add @Component because there is no @View

8. Go to Controller and add @Component beause there is no @Controller

9. Now from app we can call controller and tell it to run:
